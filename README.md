# ML-DataScience-Course
This repository contains all the code that I implemented in the 
[Machine Learning and DataScience](https://www.spegc.org/formacion-y-eventos/machine-learning-data-science/)
course organized by the SPEGC and the EOI.
Warning: The major part of it is in spanish.

### Machine Learning
This part of the course was imparted by [Carlos Santana](https://github.com/dotcsv), best known for his 
YouTube channel [Dot CSV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5znSnfMsDwaLlROnZ7Qbg)

In this part we learn how techniques like Linear Regressions, KNN, K-means, NN, CNN, Autoencoders and LSTM works.
All the practices are listed [here](https://github.com/Xirzag/ML-DataScience-Course/tree/master/ML%20excercises%20codes)

### Data Science
This subject was teached by [Israel Estéves](https://twitter.com/ieshatchuell). We practice with Qlik, D3 and handling data with python.
An exercise we made about airplanes path is uploaded [here](https://xirzag.github.io/ML-DataScience-Course/D3%20project/)

### Final Project
Also Israel and [José Luis González](https://github.com/YuniorGlez) helped as with the 
[final project](https://github.com/Xirzag/ML-DataScience-Course/tree/master/Kickstarter%20project),
that tries to predict if a Kickstarter will succeed or not.
